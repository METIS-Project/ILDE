<!--    Example tracking configuration file for using marker-based tracking.
        Marker tracking is the detection of markers in a camera image and
        the estimation of the camera position with respect to these markers.
        Markers, in contrast to natural features, are easy to detect with high
        precision, which in turn allows to estimate the camera position with
        high accuracy. 
        There are three different marker types that can be used:
        - ID marker,
        - picture marker and
        - rectangular image marker
        To use one or more of these markers for the tracking process, they need
        to be defined in the configuration file. If a marker is not defined, 
        but is seen during the tracking process, then it will simply be ignored. 
        Besides the configuration file, a camera calibration file needs to be 
        provided. A more precise camera calibration will lead to more accurate 
        tracking results, so it is advisible to use a high-quality camera 
        calibration. -->

                            There are two types available:
                            - "robust" to use a robust approach to detect the 
                              markers, which usually gives the best results, 
                              but consumes more computational time, i.e. is 
                              slower.
                            - "fast" to use a more simple approach to detect 
                              the markers, which is less precise, but faster 
                              than robust. 
                              -->
                    <TrackingQuality>Fast</TrackingQuality>
                    <!--    <TrackingQuality>fast</TrackingQuality> -->

                    <!--    The threshold which is used to binarize the camera 
                            image. Binarizing is the process where each pixel 
                            is converted to a grayscale value (between 0 and 
                            255) and then is set to 0 when the value is below 
                            the threshold and to 1 when the value is above. 
                            This helps to clearly identify the marker and is 
                            therefore important for the detection process. When 
                            the tracking quality is set to "fast", then this 
                            value is fixed and will not change during the 
                            tracking process. When the tracking quality is set 
                            to "robust", then the value is only the starting 
                            value in the very first frame after loading the 
							tracking.xml. Detecting markers using a fixed 
							threshold can lead to failure. The value range for
							the threshold is between 0 and 255.

							is set as "TrackingQuality", but is ignored for 
							"fast". The ThresholdOffset is adapted when no 
							marker was detected. 							
                            With a high number, the marker tracker is more 
                            likely to detect a marker, but it also needs more 
                            computational time, i.e. is slower. -->

		<Sensor Type="FeatureBasedSensorSource" Subtype="Fast"><!--	Assign an ID to this sensor -->
		<SensorID>FeatureTracking1</SensorID><!--	Parameters that apply to the sensor -->
		<Parameters><!--	The following feature descriptor types are available: 
						"regular", "upright", "gravity", "rectified". 
						- The "regular" feature descriptor type is the most 
						  general feature descriptor type and is used as 
						  default if the tag is not specified. 
						- The "upright" feature descriptor type assumes that 
						  the camera is not rotated with respect to the optical 
						  axis, i.e. is turned upside down, during the tracking 
						  process. 
						- The "gravity" feature descriptor type can only be 
						  used with devices with inertial sensors which 
						  measures gravity. It is used for localizing static 
						  objects that provide (close to) vertical surfaces, 
						  e.g. buildings or posters on a wall. The orientation 
						  of the features will then be aligned with gravity. 
						- The "rectified" feature descriptor type can only be 
						  used with devices with inertial sensors which 
						  measures gravity. It is used for planar objects on a 
						  horizontal surface, e.g. a magazine on a table.
						  This will improve the result of the localization of 
						  planar objects under steep camera angles at the cost 
						  of a lower framerate during localization.
						This parameter is for expert usage only. In general it 
						is advised to leave the value unchanged. --><FeatureDescriptorAlignment>regular</FeatureDescriptorAlignment><!--	A restriction on the number of reference planar objects 
						to be localized per frame. Localization takes longer 
						than interframe tracking, and if the system tries to 
						localize too many objects at the same time, it might 
						cause a lower framerate. The default value for this is 5 
						and is used if the tag is not specified.
						Another name that can be used for this parameter is 
						<MultipleReferenceImagesFast>. This name is however 
						deprecated and should not be used any more. 
						This parameter is for expert usage only. In general it 
						is advised to leave the value unchanged. --><MaxObjectsToDetectPerFrame>5</MaxObjectsToDetectPerFrame><!--	The maximum number of objects that should be tracked in 
						parallel. Tracking many objects in parallel is quite 
						expensive and might lead to a lower framerate. As soon 
						as the maximum number of tracked objects is reached, 
						the system will no longer try to localize new objects. 
						The default value for this is 1 and is used if the tag 
						is not specified. 
						Another name that can be used for this parameter is 
						<MaxNumCosesForInit>. This name is however deprecated 
						and should not be used any more. 
						This parameter is for expert usage only. In general it 
						is advised to leave the value unchanged. --><MaxObjectsToTrackInParallel>1</MaxObjectsToTrackInParallel><!--	Default similarity threshold for specifying whether
						template tracking was successful or failed. The 
						tracking quality measure is defined between -1 and 1, 
						where 1 is the best	possible value. If the tracking 
						quality	is reported to be below the threshold, the 
						tracker will treat the corresponding frame as lost. 
						The default value for this is 0.7 and is used if the 
						tag is not specified. This setting can be overridden 
						for each "COS" if it is defined there. 
						This parameter is for expert usage only. In general it 
						is advised to leave the value unchanged. --><SimilarityThreshold>0.7</SimilarityThreshold></Parameters><!--	Define a "SensorCOS" for this sensor. This is essentially a
