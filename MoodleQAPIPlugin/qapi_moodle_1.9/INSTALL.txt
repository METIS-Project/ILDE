INSTALLATION

In brief:

Copy this directory into the document root directory of a Moodle install.  Then create a new directory beneath admin/report named "qapi" and copy the index.php and versions.php files, and db and lang subdirectories contained within this directory to the just-created "qapi" directory.  Symlinks from qapi back to these files will also work.

Enable plugin by first navigating to the Administration Notifications section, and then add the trusted IP addresses of clients using the Reports Quick API] section.

In detail:

In the following example, the document root directory for the Moodle installation is named "moodle".  The parent directory of the software to be installed is named "contrib".

1. Copy the software release directory to the Moodle install:

    % cd <software-path>/contrib
    % cp -r qapi <moodle-path>/moodle

2. Create the admin/report/qapi directory:

    % cd <moodle-path>/moodle/admin/report
    % mkdir qapi

3. Copy the index.php & version .php files & db & lang dirs  to qapi directory:

    % cd <moodle-path>/moodle/qapi
    % cp -r index.php version.php db lang ../admin/report/qapi

4. Enable plugin as a Moodle administrative user:

    -- Navigate to the Notifications URL:
    e.g. http://example.com/admin/index.php

    This should provide display confirmation buttons to install the needed database table and enable the menu item for this plugin.

5. Use the new Reports menu item to enabled trusted clients:

    a. Navigate to the Quick API URL (Moodle->Admin->Reports->Quick API):
        e.g. http://example.com/admin/report/qapi/index.php
    b. Add IP addresses of trusted client as necessary.
    
6. In Ubuntu 12.04 using Nginx web server, it is necessary to define the PATH_INFO variable:
	Edit the file /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params 
	and add the following line:
	fastcgi_param   PATH_INFO               $fastcgi_path_info;
