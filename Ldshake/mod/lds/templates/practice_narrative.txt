<p><em>A Practice is a recurring&nbsp;pattern of behaviour&nbsp;manifesting certain&nbsp;intentions&nbsp;in a given&nbsp;context.</em></p>

<p><em>Arguably, the aim of (educational) design is to enhance practices: to allow people to revise their intentions and manifest their intentions in more effective and efficient ways. </em></p>

<p><em>Before we attempt to enhance practices, we need to identify existing practices. To do that, we will capture these in narratives.&nbsp;A narrative provides an account of&nbsp;Someone&nbsp;doing&nbsp;something&nbsp;in some&nbsp;context.</em></p>

<p><em>Based on ethnographic data, or any other sources, construct a narrative that describes a current practice.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h1>Synopsis</h1>

<p><strong>Who did what where and when to achive which ends?</strong></p>

<h1>Who?</h1>

<p><em>Define the &lsquo;&rsquo;actors&rsquo;&rsquo; in the narrative. These should be fictitious personas based on real people. Idealy, you should <a href="http://ilde.upf.edu/layers/pg/lds/new/template/PC">create a persona</a> for each actor and link to it from here.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Where and When?</h1>

<p><em style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Define the &lsquo;&rsquo;context&rsquo;&rsquo; of the narrative. Describe the material, social and intentional forces that shape your problem space.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>What?</h1>

<p><em>Note the intentions that your narrative focuses on: what were the actors trying to achieve? What were they trying to avoid?</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>How?</h1>

<p><em>List the actions that actors performed to satisfy their intentions.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Results..</h1>

<p><em>What were the consequences of the actors&#39; actions? To what extent were their intentions satisfied?</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Gaps and tensions</h1>

<p><em>Were are the &quot;pain points&quot;? Which intentions are unsatisfied? Which are satisfied inneffetivly or inneficiently?</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Notes, observations and reflections</h1>

<p><em>Add any thoughts and comments you have as an observer.</em></p>

<h1>Analysis and Interpretation</h1>

<p><em>Links to theory, analysis of the narrative, explanations and predictions based on theoretical frameworks.</em></p>
