clip.actions.reason.setAssessedActivity=This assessment is incomplete: it does not indicate what is the assessed activity. Therefore, it's not clear who is the assessee, nor what is to be assessed. You should fix this by selecting one 'assessed activity'.
clip.actions.reason.addAssessmentFunction=You haven't indicated how the assessment results are to be used in the script. If you think this assessment will have any impact on the students, or if you want to use the assessment results with formative purposes, you can indicate this by adding 'assessment result usages'.
clip.actions.reason.editSummativeAssessmentFunction=This assessment is going to be used to grade students, but you haven't indicated how exactly. You should describe the way in which the results of this assessment affect the students' grades.
clip.actions.reason.editFormativeAssessmentFunction=This assessment is going to be used to deliver feedback to the students. However, you haven't indicated in which activity the students will receive the feedback. You should indicate this.

clip.actions.reason.modify=According to the assessment plan, this activity is susceptible of being modified, or otherwise the teacher might intervene, according to some results of assessment '${0}'. You should configure the activity taking this fact int account.
clip.actions.reason.assessed=This activity is going to be assessed (in assessment '${0}'). Probably the configuration of this activity should take this fact into account (for instance, do you need to give instructions to the students?, or do you need to clarify to the students the type and purpose of the assessment?); if you think it's necessary, you can add that information to the description of the activity (which the students will read).
clip.actions.reason.assessment=This activity is an 'assess task'! This means that the person assigned to it will take the role of assessor. You probably should give the needed instructions to the assessor, as well as including the needed resources, so that the assessment is properly carried out. You can add this information in the description of this activity (which the assessor will read).

clip.actions.reason.assessmentAsObservation=In this activity the assessor will observe a collaborative process, in order to assess it. You should make sure that either the needed resources are available, or that the assessor has access to observe the activity. Perhaps it's necessary to make sure that this activity and the assessed activity happen at the same time (e.g., they are not in different phases of the script).
clip.actions.reason.assessedAsReportreview=This activity is assessed as a 'Report review'. Therefore, in this activity the students are expected to produce a document for the assessor. The activity should be configured accordingly.
clip.actions.reason.assessmentAsReportreview=In this 'assess task', the assessor will review the students' reports. You should write the needed intruction as to how to review the documents in the description of this activity. Additionally, you need to make sure that the assessor will have access to the documents.

clip.actions.reason.assessmentAsPresentation=In this 'assess task', the assessor will watch and assess an oral presentation. Therefore, you should include the needed instruction explaining how to assess it. Additionally, you should make sure that the assessor has access to the presentations: either as a recorded performance, or by observing it.

clip.actions.reason.assessmentAsPortfolio=In this 'assess task', the assessor is to assess students' portfolios. You should give the assessor the needed instructions (in the description of the activity). Additionally, you need to make sure that the assessor will have access to the students' portfolios.

clip.actions.reason.assessmentAsRoles=In this activity, a 'Role detection' assessment is carried out. This assessment is based on the analysis of interactions between students. You should prepare the needed software in order to be able to carry out the assessment, and link with this activity (see the 'Role detection' pattern documentation for more information about this software).
clip.actions.reason.assessmentAsRubric=In this 'assess task', 'Rubrics' are expected. Therefore, you should provide the assessor with a rubrics document (which you can link as a resource in the activity). You can include also instruction about how to use the rubrics.
clip.actions.reason.assessedAsShared=This activity is assessed, in such way that the grades are shared by all the members or each group. You should probably indicate this to the students, so that they are aware of the assessment conditions.
clip.actions.reason.assessmentAsShared=In this 'assess task', students in each group are given the same grade. You should give instructions to the assessor indicating this fact.
clip.actions.reason.assessmentAsSelf=This assessment is a 'Self-assessment'. Therefore, you need to make sure that the assessor is the same person/group as the assessee.
clip.actions.reason.assessmentAsAnonymous=This 'assess task' is anonymous. You should indicate that to the assessor (for instance, in the description of this assessment activity).
clip.actions.reason.assessmentAsIA=In this activity, an 'Interaction analysis' is carried out. This 'assess task' is based on the analysis of interactions between students. You should prepare the needed software in order to be able to carry out the 'assess task', and link with this activity (see the 'Interaction analysis' pattern documentation for more information about this software).
clip.actions.reason.assessmentAsRandom=In this 'assess task', groups are assessed by choosing one random member from each group; this member will have the responsibility of the assessment. You should give instructions to the assessor about how to pick group members and carry out the assessment.
