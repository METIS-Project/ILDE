<h1> Guidelines for particularization, instantiation and execution </h1>

<h2> Particularization/customization of the pattern into a Learning Design: </h2>

<UL>

<LI> During particularization, several tasks should be performed: first, determination of the levels of the Pyramid (from 2 to 10); this is done in a dialog showed just after the pyramid CLFP is chosen: <p>

<LI> Then, definition of objectives and prerequisites of the Learning Design, specification of each (teachers’ and learners’) activity description (definition of global problem, etc.), provision of necessary resources  (contents and tools), and decisions about completion of activities (e. g. control of time)..

</UL>

<h2> Instantiation of the Pyramid CLFP-based Learning Design: </h2>

<UL>

<LI> During instantiation, several tasks should be performed: creation of actual groups, binding of participants to the groups of each level of the Pyramid.
