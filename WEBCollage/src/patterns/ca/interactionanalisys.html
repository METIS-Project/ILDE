        <div class="problemTitle">Problem:</div>
        <div class="problem">
            <p>Participation in collaborative work affects each student's learning. However,
                under certain conditions it will be impossible to observe directly the collaborative processes;
                this may be caused by a high number of students, or in distance-learning settings.</p>
            <p>Precisely, distance work, with computer support, can be especially difficult to observe and monitor.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="solutionTitle">Solution:</div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>In those cases where collaboration is mediated by computer support,
                it is possible to gather valuable data about collaborative processes
                by means of interaction analysis software tools.</p>

            <p>This requires:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The collaborative activity to be assessed must be carried out through a computer system (such as group work software).</li>
                <li>This group work software must be capable of producing logs, which record user actions and thus the interactions between students through the system.</li>
                <li>The assessor will use these logs to understand the collaborative process.</li>
                <li>This is possible by using a second system, or <strong>interaction analysis system</strong>, capable of processing the logs to infer information about the behavior of the students.</li>
                <li>Finally, it is necessary to make sure that both systems share the same data and format for the logs, and to connect them so that the logs produced by one system can be processed by the second.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This assessment can be carried out continuously or, at least,
                can be conducted several times along the collaborative activities.</p>
            <p>Once the logs have been processed and analyzed, the results can
                be used with different purposes: give feedback to the students about
                their own work, take decisions about future learning activities, etc.</p>

        <div class="guidelinesTitle">Application guidelines:</div>
        <div class="guidelines">
            <p>In order to include this assessment technique, is is recommended:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This pattern defines the assessment technique used. Therefore, it
                    cannot be combined with any other pattern that also defines an
                    assessment technique. However, patterns that propose some
                    other additional configuration can be combined with this one.</li>
                <li>In the <i>assessed learning activity</i>, collaboration must mediated
                    by some <strong>group work (or collaborative learning) software system</strong>
                    capable of producing logs. For example, logs are generated by systems such as
                    BSCW or Synergeia. If these systems are used, they should appear as a
                    resource available for the students in the assessed learning activity.</li>
                <li>In the <i>assess task</i>, the analysis requires an <strong>interaction analysis tool</strong>,
                    such as "i-bee", "COLEMON", "Observer XT", etc. This system should be
                    included as a resource for the assessor in this activity, along with
                    instructions for the assessor as to how to use it.</li>
                <li>An example of an especialized interaction analysis is <a href="roledetection.html"><span class="patterntitle">Role detection</span></a>.</li>
