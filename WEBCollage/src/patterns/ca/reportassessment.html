            <p>Students need to show the work they have carried out during collaborative
                activities, and present the results of it.</p>

        <div class="solution">
            <p>Through written reports, students have the chance to describe and
                present their work. By assessing written reports, it is not only
                possible to grade students, but also the teacher can give
                feedback to the students, indicating the strong and weak points
                of the report. On the other hand, reports can be serve to share
                the work with other students, which can be used to prepare
                further collaborative activities.</p>

            <p>In order to include this assessment technique, is is recommended:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This pattern defines the assessment technique used. Therefore, it
                    cannot be combined with any other pattern that also defines an
                    assessment technique. However, patterns that propose some
                    other additional configuration can be combined with this one.</li>
                <li>In the <i>assessed activity</i>, students are expected to complete
                    a report, to be assessed. Therefore, instructions about this task
                    should be included in this activity.</li>
                <li>In the <i>assess task</i>, the assessor needs instructions about how
                    to assess the reports (for instance, you can include <a href="rubric.html">
                        <span class="patterntitle">Rubrics</span></a> in this activity).</li>
                <li>Additionally, it is necessary to make sure that the assessor will have access
                    to the reports to assess (in the <i>assess task</i>), especially if these are electronic resources.</li>
