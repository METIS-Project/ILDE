        <div class="problem">
            <p>Students might feel uncomfortable when they ar asked to
                assess their partners. How can we improve the situation in order to
                encourage students to engage in the assessment process?
        </div>

        <div class="solutionTitle">Solution:</div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>One possible solution to the students' reticences towards
                assessing their partners is to guarantee the assessor's
                anonymity. In this way, the students can feel more comfortable
                about expressing freely their ideas and opinions about othes'
                work.</p>
            <p>When the students take the role of assessors, an environment that
                guarantees anonymity enables more fair and precise assessments.</p>

        <div class="guidelinesTitle">Application guidelines:</div>
        <div class="guidelines">
            <p>In order to complete the application of this pattern, it is recommended:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This pattern does not define the assessment technique used,
                    only an additional aspect of the configuration of the assessment.
                    Therefore, it can be used with other patterns that define the
                    assessment technique.</li>
                <li>In the <i>assess task</i>, the assessor must know that anonymity
                    is guaranteed. This can affect the way the assess task is
                    condicted. This information can be included in the description
                    of the activity.</li>
                <li>If the assess task is completed through computers, a mechanisms
                    to guarantee anonymity has to be employed.</li>
