        <div class="problem">
            <p>Occasionaly, the assessor may be confused about the assessment criteria.
                This may be especially relevant when the students are given the role
                of assessors.</p>

        <div class="solutionTitle">Solution:</div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>In order to guide the assess task, you can use <strong>Rubrics</strong>.
                A rubric is a document that describes the criteria and standards
                that the assessor should consider in the assessment.</p>
            <p>Rubrics also serve to indicate the learning objectives that should
                be addressed in the assessment. In this way, the rubric serves
                as instructions to the assessor, not only about how to assess,
                but also what to assess.</p>
            <p>Rubrics can be provided as a document included in the script (that
                is, a document written in the process of editing the script). However,
                when the assessor role is played by the students, it may be useful
                to prepare activities in which students discuss the criteria and
                dimensions of the rubrics. In this way, it is possible to
                improve the students' understanding of the assessment criteria,
                thus facilitating the task of assessing. Finally, the creation
                of the rubric can also be a learning activity in itself.</p>

        <div class="guidelinesTitle">Application guidelines:</div>
        <div class="guidelines">
            <p>To include this pattern in a script, it is recommended:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This pattern does not define the assessment technique used,
                    only an additional aspect of the configuration of the assessment.
                    Therefore, it can be used with other patterns that define the
                    assessment technique.</li>
                <li>The rubric should be included in the <i>assess task</i>, as
                    a resource available for the assessor.</li>
                <li>You can write intructions in the description of the <i>assess task</i>
                    about how to use the rubric.</li>
