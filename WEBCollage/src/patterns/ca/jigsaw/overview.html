<h1> Overview </h1>

This pattern gives the collaborative learning flow for a context in which several small groups are facing the study of a lot of information for the resolution of the same problem.

<h2> Problem </h2>

<b>Complex problem/task that can be easily divided into sections or independent sub-problems.</b>


<h2> Educational benefits </h2>

<UL>
<LI> To promote the feeling that team members need each other to succeed (positive interdependence)
<LI> To foster discussion in order to construct students’ knowledge
<LI> To ensure that students must contribute their fare share (individual accountability).
</UL>

<h2> Complexity </h2>

<b>High-risk</b>: more appropriate for collaborative learning experienced individuals. 

<h2> Solution </h2>

Each participant (individual or initial group) in a group (<i>Jigsaw Group</i>) studies or work around a particular sub-problem. The participants of different groups that study the same problem meet in an <i>Expert Group</i> for exchanging ideas. These temporary focus groups become experts in the section of the problem given to them. At last, participants of each <i>Jigsaw group</i> meet to contribute with its <i>expertise</i> in order to solve the whole problem.
