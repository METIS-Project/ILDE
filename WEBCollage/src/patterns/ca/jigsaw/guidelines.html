<h1> Guidelines for particularization, instantiation and execution </h1>

<h2> Particularization/customization of the pattern into a Learning Design: </h2>

<UL>

<LI> During particularization, several tasks should be performed: definition of objectives and prerequisites of the Learning Design, specification of each (teachers’ and learners’) activity description (definition of global problem, subproblems, etc.), provision of necessary resources (contents and tools), and decisions about completion of activities (e.g. control of time).

<LI> You might want to provide experts with a tool so that they can take notes during the focus group that provide support when the original group re-assembles.

</UL>

<h2> Instantiation of the Jigsaw CLFP-based Learning Design: </h2>

<UL>

<LI> During instantiation, several tasks should be performed: creation of particular jigsaw groups, binding of expert type to each member of the groups (and thus creating expert groups).

<LI> Being the only expert in a sub-problem in the “Jigsaw Group" can be a demanding experience for students. This can be mitigated if two group members share the same section of the problem: two members of each group are bound to the same expert type.
