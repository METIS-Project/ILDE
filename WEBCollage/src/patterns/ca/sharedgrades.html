        <div class="problem">
            <p>Assessment and grading may bring students to the conclusion that
                it is not worthy to put effort in collaborative work, for instance
                if their grades depend only on their own individual work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="solutionTitle">Solution:</div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>In these cases, possitive interdependence should be fostered, that
                is, make that all group members are necessary to achieve a goal.
                This goal may be related to the grade that the students are
                given.</p>
            <p>By making that part of the students' grade is shared among all
                group members, possitive interdependece can be fostered, if
                the reward that each student receives depends on other students. </p>
            <p>One way of applying this patterns is to make the students' grade
                dependent on their partners' achievements. For instance, certain
                part of the grade can be given only if all group members
                achieve certain learning objective. Another example of this
                pattern can be found in
                <a href="random.html"><span class="patterntitle">
                        Random group member assessment</span></a>.</p>

        <div class="guidelinesTitle">Application guidelines:</div>
        <div class="guidelines">
            <p>To apply this pattern, please consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This pattern does not define the assessment technique used,
                    only an additional aspect of the configuration of the assessment.
                    Therefore, it can be used with other patterns that define the
                    assessment technique.</li>
                <li>In the <i>assessed activity</i>, students must be aware of the
                    way the assessment is going to be conducted. knowing the type
                    of assessment parpares them to face the assessment, and
                    increases the chances that the assessment will have the
                    aforementioned benefits on learning.</li>
                <li>In the <i>assess task</i>, instructions should be given to
                    the assessor about how to conduct the assessment.</li>
                <li>It would be adequate to indicate that one of the usages of
                    the assessment results is "to grade students".</li>
