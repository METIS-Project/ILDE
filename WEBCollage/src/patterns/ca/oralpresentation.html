        <div class="problem">
            <p>Work produced in groups needs to be explained and defended by the students,
                in front of the teacher and the rest of students.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="solutionTitle">Solution:</div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>Oral presentations give a chance to students to show and defend
                the work they have carried out. Through this technique, it is
                possible to assess whether the students are capable of
                explaining and argumenting their work. Additionally, an oral
                presentation give the chance to look deeper into the understanding
                of the student, if questions are allowed. Finally, presentations
                can be used to have all the students listen to other groups'
                work, and in this way prepare richer discussions.</p>

        <div class="guidelinesTitle">Application guidelines:</div>
        <div class="guidelines">
            <p>In order to include this assessment technique, is is recommended:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This pattern defines the assessment technique used. Therefore, it
                    cannot be combined with any other pattern that also defines an
                    assessment technique. However, patterns that propose some
                    other additional configuration can be combined with this one.</li>
                <li>Instructions should be included in the <i>assessed activity</i>: this is the
                    activity where students perform the presentation.</li>
                <li>In the <i>assess task</i>, instructions should be included for
                    the assessor. For instance, you can include a 
                    <a href="rubric.html"><span class="patterntitle">Rubric</span></a>,
                    to clarify the assessment criteria.</li>
                <li>It is necessary to make sure that the assessor will have access
                    to the presentation. For instance, the <i>assess task</i> should happen
                    at the same time as the <i>assessed activity</i> (the presentation itself).
                    An alternative to this is to provide the assessor with a recording
                    of the presentation instead (this could be a resource included in the
                    <i>assess task</i>).</li>
