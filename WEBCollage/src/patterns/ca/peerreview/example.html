        <p>Assessment of software and code.</p>
        <p>Writing maintainable code is a relevant skill for a software developer,
            but it is not usually developed through lessons. Since in a professional
            setting software sill be used by several actors, it is important to
            adopt certain good practices.</p>
        <p>Therefore, reviewing software code can be a useful learnign activity for the
            students to uderstand problems in their code and good practices (such as
            following code style, writing adequate commentaries, etc.)</p>
        <p>This can be achieved through a Peer review: students exchange their code,
            review it, and give feedback to the authors.</p>
