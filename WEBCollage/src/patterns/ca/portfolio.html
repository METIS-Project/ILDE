        <div class="problem">
            <p>How can we assess the achievements and development of students
                over a period of time?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="solutionTitle">Solution:</div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p><i>Portfolio assessment</i> has been proposed as an alternative
                form of assessment, attempting to gather together evidentes of the
                achievements and progress of the students. Students' works, along
                with their reflections on them, can serve as a source of information
                about the competencies, knowledge and abilities, possibly
                more reliable than other means of assessment.</p>
            <p>Additionally, a portfolio compiled by a student can show not only
                their learning achievements, but also the learning process,
                giving information about how the competencies have been
                developed.</p>
            <p>Finally, a portfolio is adequate to follow long-term projects,
                and it gives a context for the revision, guidance and critique
                of students' work.</p>

        <div class="guidelinesTitle">Application guidelines:</div>
        <div class="guidelines">
            <p>In order to include this assessment technique, is is recommended:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This pattern defines the assessment technique used. Therefore, it
                    cannot be combined with any other pattern that also defines an
                    assessment technique. However, patterns that propose some
                    other additional configuration can be combined with this one.</li>
                <li>The portfolio is compiled over a period of time. Therefore,
                    there can be several activities in which students complete
                    the porfolio (or this can be a resource present in all the
                    learning activities).</li>
                <li>If a script has a long duration (for instance, a whole course),
                    there can exist several assessments of the same
                    portfolio, at different moments. These would have to be
                    created independently in Web Collage.</li>
                <li>In the <i>assessed activity</i>, students are expected to
                    compile and prepare for evaluation their portfolios. Therefore,
                    the corresponding instructions should be included in this
                    activity.</li>
                <li>The assessor reviews the portfolios in the <i>assessed activity</i>.
                    Therefore, instructions should be given as to how accomplish
                    this task. Also, it is necessary to make sure that the assessor
                    will have access to the portfolios, if these are electronic resources.</li>
