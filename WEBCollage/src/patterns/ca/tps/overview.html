<h1> Overview </h1>

This pattern gives the collaborative learning flow for a context in which students are paired to solve a challenging or openended question.

<h2> Problem </h2>

<b>A challenging or open-ended question.</b>


<h2> Educational benefits </h2>

<UL>
<LI> To promote the feeling that team members need each other to succeed (positive interdependence).
<LI> To foster discussion in order to construct students’ knowledge.
<LI> To focus students’ attention on a particular topic.
<LI> To give a chance to formulate answers by retrieving information from long-term memory.
</UL>

<h2> Complexity </h2>

<b>Low-risk</b>: ideally suited for individuals who are new to collaborative learning.

<h2> Solution </h2>

Each participant has time to think about the question. They pair and discuss their ideas about the question. (They could write down their thoughts.) Then, they comment or take a classroom “vote”. Students are much more willing to respond after they have had a chance to discuss their ideas with a classmate because if the answer is wrong, the embarrassment is shared. Also, the responses received are often more intellectually concise since students have had a chance to reflect on their ideas with the one another.
