<h1> Guidelines for particularization, instantiation and execution </h1>

<h2> Particularization/customization of the pattern into a Learning Design: </h2>

<UL>

<LI> During particularization, several tasks should be performed: definition of objectives and prerequisites of the Learning Design, specification of each (teachers’ and learners’) activity description (definition of the question, etc.), provision of necessary resources (contents and tools), and decisions about completion of activities (e. g. control of time).

<LI> You might want to provide pairs with a tool so that they can take notes during the discussion.

</UL>

<h2> Instantiation of the Think Pair Share CLFP-based Learning Design: </h2>

<UL>

<LI> During instantiation, several tasks should be performed: creation of groups (pairs), binding individuals to pairs.
