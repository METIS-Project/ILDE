        <div class="problem">
            <p>In collaborative work, it may happen that the distribution of tasks
                within a group makes it difficult for all the members to understand the
                work carried out by all the members, or even the global solution.
                On the other hand, there is also a risk that some group members do not
                contribute with their own share, and relies in their partners to complete
                the assigned work.</p>

        <div class="solutionTitle">Solution:</div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>In these cases, individual accountability needs to be fostered
                among all members in each group. A possibility to achieve this
                is to propose an assessment that only one member of each group
                will take. This member will be chosen randomly, and the grade
                achieved will be given to all members in their groups.</p>

            <p>By means of this type of assessment, all students are aware
                of their responsibility towards the group. Additionally, they
                will have an interest in making sure that all group members
                reach the learning objectives, so that they can achieve a good
                grade. Thus, students are encourage to help their partners
                participate and understand the covered topics or problems.</p>

        <div class="guidelinesTitle">Application guidelines:</div>
        <div class="guidelines">
            <p>To apply this pattern in an assessment, please consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This pattern does not define the assessment technique used,
                    only an additional aspect of the configuration of the assessment.
                    Therefore, it can be used with other patterns that define the
                    assessment technique.</li>
                <li>In the <i>assessed activity</i>, students must be aware of the
                    way the assessment is going to be conducted. knowing the type
                    of assessment parpares them to face the assessment, and
                    increases the chances that the assessment will have the
                    aforementioned benefits on learning.</li>
                <li>In the <i>assess task</i>, instructions should be given to
                    the assessor about how to conduct the assessment.</li>
                <li>It would be adequate to indicate that one of the usages of
                    the assessment results is "to grade students".</li>
                <li>This pattern can be considered as a particular case of
