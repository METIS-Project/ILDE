        <div class="problem">
            <p>How can we assess the students' ability to apply knowledge and skills
                to situation similar to those that they will find in the 'real world'?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="solutionTitle">Solution:</div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>Prepare activities that put students in situations similar to
                those they will find in their professional career; assess the
                application of knowledge, skills and abilities in those
                situations.</p>
            <p>This type of assessment can focus on the products that the task
                is expected to produce; on the other hand, it is also possible
                to observe the procedures and bahevior of the students, in order
                to gather information about their knowledge and skills.</p>
            <p>Performance assessment can be organized as a simulation, reflecting
                typical situations of the work environment in which the students
                will find themselves. On the other hand, software and hardware
                systems can be used to aid the simulations: in some cases, systems
                as sofisticated as flight simulators, or simulations of laboratory
                equipment can be used.</p>
            <p>Other examples of performance assessment can include more
                traditional methods: <a href="reportassessment.html">
                    <span class="patterntitle">Review of written report</span>
                </a> can be used to measure writing skills. An assessment of an
                <a href="oralpresentation.html"><span class="patterntitle">Oral
                        presentation</span></a> can also serve to assess the
                students' public speaking skills.</p>

        <div class="guidelinesTitle">Application guidelines:</div>
        <div class="guidelines">
            <p>In order to include this assessment technique, is is recommended:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This pattern defines the assessment technique used. Therefore, it
                    cannot be combined with any other pattern that also defines an
                    assessment technique. However, patterns that propose some
                    other additional configuration can be combined with this one.</li>
                <li>Instructions should be included in the <i>assessed activity</i>: this is the
                    activity where students perform the assigned task.</li>
                <li>In the <i>assess task</i>, instructions should be included for
                    the assessor. For instance, you can include a
                    <a href="rubric.html"><span class="patterntitle">Rubric</span></a>,
                    to clarify the assessment criteria.</li>
                <li>It is necessary to make sure that the assessor will have access
                    to the presentation. For instance, the <i>assess task</i> should happen
                    at the same time as the <i>assessed activity</i> (the students' performance itself).
                    An alternative to this is to provide the assessor with a recording
                    of the performance instead (this could be a resource included in the
                    <i>assess task</i>).</li>
