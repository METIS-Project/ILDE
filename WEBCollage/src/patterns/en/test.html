            <p>The teacher needs to assess students (knowledge, skills and abilities)
                individually.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="solutionTitle">Solution:</div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>Test and written exams are a typical way of assessing students
                individually. The answers to the test allow the teacher gather
                evidence of the students' knowledge, abilities and skills with
                respect to the test contents.</p>
            <p>If the assessment is necessary for certification of students'
                achievements, tests can be safer than other forms of assessment
                against cheating attempts.</p>
            <p>However, tests might not be the adequate assessment form, depending
                on the objective of the assessment; for instance, written tests
                so not show practical abilities.</p>

        <div class="guidelinesTitle">Application guidelines:</div>
        <div class="guidelines">
            <p>In order to include this assessment technique, is is recommended:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This pattern defines the assessment technique used. Therefore, it
                    cannot be combined with any other pattern that also defines an
                    assessment technique. However, patterns that propose some
                    other additional configuration can be combined with this one.</li>
                <li>It is recommended that test results are assessed against a set
                    of criteria (for instance, using a
                    <a href="rubric.html"><span class="patterntitle">Rubric</span></a>)
                    and that grades are not curved.</li>
                <li>Students fill the test in the <i>assessed activity</i>.
                    Therefore, instructions should be given about how to complete the test.
                    Additionally, if a computer system is used to deliver the assessment,
                    the test should be included in this activity as a resource (preparing
                    the test is part of the creation of  the script).</li>
                <li>The assessor reviews the test in the <i>assessed activity</i>.
                    Therefore, instructions should be given as to how to correct
                    the test. Also, it is necessary to make sure that the assessor
                    will have access to the tests, if these are answered through computers.</li>
