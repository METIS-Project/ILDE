<h2> Complexity </h2>

<b>Low-risk</b>: ideally suited for individuals who are new to collaborative learning.

<h2> Solution </h2>

The teacher asks a question that has a large number of possible answers. Students in the same group write down (using a determined floor control) their answers. This process continues until the students run out of possible solutions. After the brainstorming, the teacher gives time for the team to review and clarify their ideas. If needed, the group can present the generated ideas to the rest of the class.
