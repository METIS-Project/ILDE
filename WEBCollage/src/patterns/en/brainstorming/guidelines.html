<h1> Guidelines for particularization, instantiation and execution </h1>

<h2> Particularization/customization of the pattern into a Learning Design: </h2>

<UL>

<LI> During particularization, several tasks should be performed: definition of objectives and prerequisites of the Learning Design, specification of each (teachers’ and learners’) activity description (definition of the topic of the brainstorming, etc.), provision of necessary resources (contents and tools), and decisions about completion of activities (e. g. control of time).

<LI> You might want to provide brainstorming groups a tool so that they can take notes during the brainstorming that provide support for the next activities.

</UL>

<h2> Instantiation of the Brainstorming CLFP-based Learning Design: </h2>

<UL>

<LI> During instantiation, several tasks should be performed: creation of particular brainstorming groups, binding each individual to a group.

</UL>
