<h2> Complexity </h2>

<b>Medium-risk</b>.

<h2> Solution </h2>

Each individual participant studies the problem and proposes a solution. Groups (usually pairs) of participants compare and discuss their proposals and, finally, propose a new shared solution. Those groups join in larger groups in order to generate new agreed proposal. At the end, all the participants must propose a final and agreed solution.
