        <div class="problem">
            <p>In collaborative face-to-face settings,
                how can the teacher gather information about group work?</p>

        </div>

        <div class="solutionTitle">Solution:</div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>In order to gather information about the collaborative process
                when it happens in a face-to-face setting, it is possible to
                observe directly the collaboration. This is accomplished by the
                assessor, taking notes about all the relevant aspects of collaboration:
                interactions between group members, work strategy, how conflicts are
                solved, etc.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, there is software available to support this
                type of assessment. For instance, the ILOCA software tool can be
                used to facilitate the task of recording information about
                interactions between students.</p>
            <p>Observation can be used to intervene in the activity and correct
                situations that hinder the achievement of the learning objectives.
                On the other hand, the observations can be used by the teacher to
                produce feedback reports, for the students to be aware of the way
                they are working.</p>

        <div class="guidelinesTitle">Application guidelines:</div>
        <div class="guidelines">
            <p>In order to include this assessment technique, is is recommended:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This pattern defines the assessment technique used. Therefore, it
                    cannot be combined with any other pattern that also defines an
                    assessment technique. However, patterns that propose some
                    other additional configuration can be combined with this one.</li>
                <li>In the <i>assess task</i>, there should be instructions for
                    the assessor about how to observe collaboration. For instance,
                    you can include <a href="rubric.html"><span class="patterntitle">Rubrics</span></a>,
                    to show what the assessment criteria are.</li>
                <li>It is necessary to make sure that the <i>assess task</i> is
                    carried out at the same time as the <i>assessed collaborative learning
                        activity</i>.
