        <div class="problem">
            <p>In collaborative learning, it is important that groups and students
                are capable of managing their own organization of group work, and
                if keeping effective work relationships. To achieve this, they need
                to be aware of the way they are working, and the problems they
                might have.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="solutionTitle">Solution:</div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>To avoid that groups of students stop working effectively, it is
                a good idea to reserve some time for them to self-assess their
                own work. By analyzing their own performance and problems in
                their work, the students can identify positive and negative
                actions, and can take decisions to correct the existing problems.</p>

            <p>In order to engage students in this self-assessment task, explicit
                activities should be created, indicating clearly their objective
                and purpose.</p>

            <p>By means of self-assessment, not only can students work more
                efficiently, but also feedback given to their group partners can
                improve their learning of collaboration abilities.</p>

        <div class="guidelinesTitle">Application guidelines:</div>
        <div class="guidelines">
            <p>To set a self-assessment in a script, it is recommended:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This pattern does not define the assessment technique used,
                    only an additional aspect of the configuration of the assessment.
                    Therefore, it can be used with other patterns that define the
                    assessment technique.</li>
                <li>Since the assessor and assessee are the same person or group, it may be 
                    adequate to check that the <i>assessed activity</i> and the <i>assess task</i>
                    are assigned to the same role (this is not mandatory though). In any case,
                    the assessors should be the students.</li>
                <li>In the <i>assess task</i>, instructions should be given for the assessor,
                    indicating the purpose of the assessment, according to the
                    aforementioned potential benefits of self-assessment.</li>
            </ul>
