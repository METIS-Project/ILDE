<h1> Guidelines for particularization, instantiation and execution </h1>

<h2> Particularization/customization of the pattern into a Learning Design: </h2>

<UL>

<LI> During particularization, several tasks should be performed: determination of number of problems (and thus, phases),
definition of objectives and prerequisites of the Learning Design, specification of each (teachers’ and learners’) activity
