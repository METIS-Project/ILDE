<h1> Overview </h1>

This pattern gives the collaborative learning flow for a context in which students are paired and given a series of problems.

<h2> Problem </h2>

<b>A series of problems, whose solutions imply reasoning processes.</b>


<h2> Educational benefits </h2>

<UL>
<LI> To foster discussion in order to construct students’ knowledge.
<LI> To permit students to rehearse the concepts and produce a deeper understanding of the material.
<LI> To encourage analytical reasoning skills.
<LI> To support problem solving skills.

<h2> Complexity </h2>

<b>Medium-risk</b>.

<h2> Solution </h2>

Students are paired and given a series of problems. The two students are given specific roles that switch with each problem: Problem Solver and Listener. The problem solver reads the problem aloud and talks through the solution of the problem. The other (the Listener) follows all of the problem solver’s steps and catches any errors that occur. The Listener may ask questions if the problem solver’s thought process becomes unclear. The question asked, however, should not guide the problem solver to a solution nor should they explicitly highlight a specific error except to comment that an error has been made.
