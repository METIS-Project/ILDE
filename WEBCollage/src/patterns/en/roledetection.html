        <div class="problem">
            <p>During collaborative work, students may take spontaneously different
                participative and functional roles. These roles determine the way
                that they participate in group worl, both in terms of participantion
                and the tasks or responsibilities they assume. Therefore, in order to
                understand collaborative work, it is important to know the roles that
                each student plays.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="solutionTitle">Solution:</div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>There are techniques to infer automatically the roles that 
                students play in collaborative learning activities. When
                collaboration is mediated by computers (using <strong>group work
                    systems</strong>, for instance), it is possible to gather
                valuable information about the participation of each student
                from the logs produced by such systems.</p>
            <p>Then, in a computer-mediated setting, a possible way of assessing
                collaboration, is to use an <strong>software interaction analysis
                    tool</strong> with support to detect the roles played by the
                students.</p>
            <p>This tool will process the logs generated by the group work system
                and attempt to characterize the roles that the students take,
                from the information about that actions that these carry out on
                the system.</p>
            <p>Once the logs have been processed and analyzed, the results can
                be used with different purposes: give feedback to the students about
                their own work (the role they are playing),
                take decisions about future learning activities, etc.</p>

        <div class="guidelinesTitle">Application guidelines:</div>
        <div class="guidelines">
            <p>In order to include this assessment technique, is is recommended:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This pattern defines the assessment technique used. Therefore, it
                    cannot be combined with any other pattern that also defines an
                    assessment technique. However, patterns that propose some
                    other additional configuration can be combined with this one.</li>
                <li>In the <i>assessed learning activity</i>, collaboration must mediated
                    by some <strong>group work (or collaborative learning) software system</strong>
                    capable of producing logs. For example, logs are generated by systems such as
                    BSCW or Synergeia. If these systems are used, they should appear as a
                    resource available for the students in the assessed learning activity.</li>
                <li>In the <i>assess task</i>, the analysis requires an <strong>interaction analysis tool
                        with support to detect roles</strong>,
                    such as "SAMSA". This system should be
                    included as a resource for the assessor in this activity, along with
                    instructions for the assessor as to how to use it.</li>
                <li>The roles that the students may take can depend partially on the
                    type of collaborative activity and assigned tasks. Therefore, the interaction
                    analysis tool should be configured to take this into account.</li>
                <li>Finally, the configuration of the script should make sure that
                    the logs will be accesible and processed by the interaction
                    analysis tool, and that the format of the logs is compatible
                    with boths systems.</li>
                <li>This pattern can be considered as a particular example of 
                    <a href="interactionanalysis.html"><span class="patterntitle">Interaction analysis</span></a>.
                    Both patterns are applied in a similar manner.</li>
