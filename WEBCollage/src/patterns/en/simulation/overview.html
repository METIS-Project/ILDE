<h1> Overview </h1>

This pattern gives the collaborative learning flow for a context in which the members of one or several groups perform a character in a simulation. 

<h2> Problem </h2>

<b> Problem whose resolution implies the simulation of a situation in which several characters are involved.</b>


<h2> Educational benefits </h2>

<UL>
<LI> To promote the feeling that team members need each other to succeed (positive interdependence).
<LI> To ensure that students must contribute their fare share (individual accountability).
</UL>

<h2> Complexity </h2>

<b>Medium-risk</b>.

<h2> Solution </h2>

Each participant consults information about the <i>problem</i> to be simulated and prepare the role of their character.
Then, the participants in the same simulation group (usually small groups) perform a particular situation related to
the <i>problem</i>. After that, the trained simulations can be performed to the rest of the class (large group). Finally, the
whole class can discuss and share their conclusion about the <i>problem</i>.
