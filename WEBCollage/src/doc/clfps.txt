Implementing CLFPs

Functions that must be implemented:

* Factory

 - create(): clfp
there must be a Factory object (e.g., PyramidFactory) with a method to create a pattern 
(including particularization, such as number of levels in a pyramid):
	
* The clfp object

 - getLearners(): [Role]
returns an array with the top level learners of the role structure.

 - getStaff(): [Role]
returns an array with the top level staff of the role structure.

 - getFlow(): [Act]
returns an ordered array with the acts of the CLFP.
 
 - getRenderer(): object
returns the renderer capable of doing "paint(surface, clfp, transform)";
 
 - getPatternName(): String
returns the static name of the pattern.

 
* Renderer

 - paint(clfp, surface, transform, detailedLinks): void
 
 - getSize(): {width: number, height: number}
 
 - getDesiredPositionForSubplay(clfp, index): {x: number, y: number}
