    methods are parsed differently (PB needs more information from them than
    z.i extracts, and the methods can be specified with a RemoteMethodSchema
    directly).

    RemoteInterfaces can accept the following additional attribute:

     __remote_name__: can be set to a string to specify the globally-unique
                      name for this interface. This should be a URL in a
                      namespace you administer. If not set, defaults to the
                      fully qualified classname.

    RIFoo.names() returns the list of remote method names.

    RIFoo['bar'] is still used to get information about method 'bar', however
    it returns a RemoteMethodSchema instead of a z.i Method instance.
