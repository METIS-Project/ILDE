    Promises are always in one of three states: Eventual, Fulfilled, and
    Broken. (see http://www.erights.org/elib/concurrency/refmech.html for a
    pretty picture). They start as Eventual, meaning we do not yet know
    whether they will resolve or not. In this state, method invocations are
    queued. Eventually the Promise will be 'resolved' into either the
    Fulfilled or the Broken state. Fulfilled means that the promise contains
    a live object to which methods can be dispatched synchronously. Broken
    promises are incapable of invoking methods: they all result in Failure.

    Method invocation is always asynchronous: it always returns a Promise.
