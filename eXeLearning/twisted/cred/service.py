"""DEPRECATED.

Twisted Cred Service

Maintainer: U{Glyph Lefkowitz<mailto:glyph@twistedmatrix.com>}

Stability: semi-stable

Future Plans: This module needs a little bit of finalization and cleanup, and
will probably have the errors for missing or non-cached perspectives be more
clearly defined.
