"""DEPRECATED.

Base authentication mechanisms for Twisted.

Maintainer: U{Glyph Lefkowitz<mailto:glyph@twistedmatrix.com>}

Stability: semi-stable

Future Plans: There needs to be more pluggable support for different, disparate
authentication mechanisms being supported by the same Identity as long as it
supports the appropriate persistent data-storage fields.  This will likely be
accomplished with Adapters and possibly Componentized, although it may just be
the addition of more methods in the base Identity.
