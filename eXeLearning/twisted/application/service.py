"""Service architecture for Twisted

Services are arranged in a hierarchy. At the leafs of the hierarchy,
the services which actually interact with the outside world are started.
Services can be named or anonymous -- usually, they will be named if
there is need to access them through the hierarchy (from a parent or
a sibling).
