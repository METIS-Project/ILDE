"""
This module provides support for Twisted to interact with the glib mainloop.
This is like gtk2, but slightly faster and does not require a working
$DISPLAY. However, you cannot run GUIs under this reactor: for that you must
use the gtk2reactor instead.

In order to use this support, simply do the following::

    |  from twisted.internet import glib2reactor
    |  glib2reactor.install()

Then use twisted.internet APIs as usual.  The other methods here are not
intended to be called directly.

When installing the reactor, you can choose whether to use the glib
event loop or the GTK+ event loop which is based on it but adds GUI
integration.

API Stability: stable
