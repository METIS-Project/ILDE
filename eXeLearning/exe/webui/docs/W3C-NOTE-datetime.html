<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This document defines a profile of ISO 8601, the International Standard
for the representation of dates and times.
ISO 8601 describes a large number of date/time formats.
To reduce the scope for error and the complexity of
software, it is useful to restrict the supported formats to a small
number.  This profile defines a few date/time formats, likely to satisfy
most requirements.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The International Standard for the representation of dates and times
is ISO 8601.  Its full reference number is ISO 8601 : 1988 (E), and its
title is "Data elements and interchange formats - Information interchange -
Representation of dates and times".
A <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Emgk25/iso-time.html">discussion</a> of
ISO 8601 has been written by Markus Kuhn.</p>

<p>ISO 8601 describes a large number of date/time formats.
For example it defines Basic Format, without punctuation,
and Extended Format, with punctuation, and it allows elements to be omitted.
This profile defines a restricted range of formats, all of which are
valid ISO 8601 dates and times.
The aim is to simplify the use of ISO 8601 in World Wide Web-related
standards,
and to avoid the need for the developers and users of these standards to
obtain
copies of ISO 8601 itself.</p>

<p>A particular problem with ISO 8601 is that it allows the century to be
omitted from years, which is likely to cause trouble as we approach the year
2000.
This profile avoids the problem by expressing the year as four digits
in all cases.</p>

<p>This profile may be adopted by standards which require an unambiguous
representation of dates and times.  As different standards have their
own requirements regarding granularity and flexibility, this profile
offers a number of options.  An adopting standard must specify which of
these options it permits.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Formats</h2>

<p>Different standards may need different levels of granularity in the date
and
time, so this profile defines six levels.
Standards that reference this profile should specify one or more of these
granularities.
If a given standard allows more than one granularity, it should specify
the meaning of the dates and times with reduced precision,
for example, the result of comparing two dates with different precisions.</p>

<p>The formats are as follows.
Exactly the components shown here must be present, with exactly this
punctuation.
Note that the "T" appears literally in
the string, to indicate the beginning of the time element, as specified in
ISO 8601.
</p>

<pre>   Year:
      YYYY (eg 1997)
   Year and month:
      YYYY-MM (eg 1997-07)
   Complete date:
      YYYY-MM-DD (eg 1997-07-16)
   Complete date plus hours and minutes:
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20+01:00)
   Complete date plus hours, minutes and seconds:
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00)
   Complete date plus hours, minutes, seconds and a decimal fraction of a
second
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00)
</pre>

<p>where:</p>

<pre>     YYYY = four-digit year
     MM   = two-digit month (01=January, etc.)
     DD   = two-digit day of month (01 through 31)
     hh   = two digits of hour (00 through 23) (am/pm NOT allowed)
     mm   = two digits of minute (00 through 59)
     ss   = two digits of second (00 through 59)
     s    = one or more digits representing a decimal fraction of a second
     TZD  = time zone designator (Z or +hh:mm or -hh:mm)
</pre>

<p>This profile does not specify how many digits may be used to represent
the decimal fraction of a second.  An adopting standard that permits
fractions of a second must specify
both the minimum number of digits (a number greater than or equal to
one) and the maximum number of digits (the maximum may be stated to be
"unlimited").</p>

<p>This profile defines two ways of handling time zone offsets:</p>

<ol>
<li>Times are expressed in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), with a
    special UTC designator ("Z").
</li><li>Times are expressed in local time, together with a time zone offset 
    in hours and minutes.  A time zone offset of "+hh:mm" indicates that
    the date/time uses a local time zone which is "hh" hours and "mm" 
    minutes ahead of UTC.  A time zone offset of "-hh:mm" indicates that
    the date/time uses a local time zone which is "hh" hours and "mm" 
    minutes behind UTC.
</li></ol>

<p>A standard referencing this profile should permit one or both of these 
ways of handling time zone offsets.</p>
