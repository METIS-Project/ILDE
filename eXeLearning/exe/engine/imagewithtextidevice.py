<b>Integrating visuals with verbal summaries</b>
</p><p>
Cognitive psychologists indicate that presenting learners with a
representative image and corresponding verbal summary (that is presented
simultaneously) can reduce cognitive load and enhance learning retention.
This iDevice can be used to present an image (photograph, diagram or
graphic) with a brief verbal summary covering the main points relating to
the image. For example, if you were teaching the functions of a four-stroke
combustion engine, you could have a visual for each of the four positions of
the piston with a brief textual summary of the key aspects of each visual.
