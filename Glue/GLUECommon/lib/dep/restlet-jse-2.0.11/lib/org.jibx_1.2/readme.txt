JiBX: Binding XML to Java Code
------------------------------

"JiBX is a framework for binding XML data to Java objects. It lets you work 
with data from XML documents using your own class structures. The JiBX 
framework handles all the details of converting your data to and from XML 
based on your instructions. JiBX is designed to perform the translation between 
internal data structures and XML with very high efficiency, but still allows 
you a high degree of control over the translation process."
