4. Reciprocity Concerning Patent Licenses.  

	a.  With respect to any patent claims covered by the license granted under subparagraph 2 above that would be infringed by all technically feasible implementations of the Specification, such license is conditioned upon your offering on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, to any party seeking it from You, a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license under Your patent rights which are or would be infringed by all technically feasible implementations of the Specification to develop, distribute and use a Compliant Implementation.

	b  With respect to any patent claims owned by Sun and covered by the license granted under subparagraph 2, whether or not their infringement can be avoided in a technically feasible manner when implementing the Specification, such license shall terminate with respect to such claims if You initiate a claim against Sun that it has, in the course of performing its responsibilities as the Sun, induced any other entity to infringe Your patent rights.

	c  Also with respect to any patent claims owned by Sun and covered by the license granted under subparagraph, where the infringement of such claims can be avoided in a technically feasible manner when implementing the Specification such license, with respect to such claims, shall terminate if You initiate a claim against Sun  that its making, having made, using, offering to sell, selling or importing a Compliant Implementation infringes Your patent rights.

5. Definitions.

 elease but against which You elect to test Your implementation of the Specification.
