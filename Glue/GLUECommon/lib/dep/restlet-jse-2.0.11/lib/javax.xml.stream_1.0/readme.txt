Java Architecture for XML Streaming (StAX)
------------------------------------------

"The Streaming API for XML (StAX) is the new generation of XML APIs in Java. 
StAX is based on the so-called pull model in which an application queries 
the parser for the next parsing event, but never surrenders control to the 
parser during the process. Stated differently, StAX essentially turns the 
SAX processing model upside down. Instead of the parser controlling the 
application's flow, and the application reacting to parsing events, it is 
the application that controls the flow by pulling events from the parser."
