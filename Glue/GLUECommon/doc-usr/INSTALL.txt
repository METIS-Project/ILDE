# PRELIMINARY NOTES #
#####################

The binary distribution of GLUE has been packaged and tested for its use in 
GNU/Linux or Windows (XP, Vista or 7) systems. However, as a Java Standard 
Edition 6 (JSE6) program, it will probably run in other operating systems 
where a JSE6 runtime platform is available. Even so, this document will
describe the installation and configuration process just for Linux and Windows
systems, highlighting their differences when needed. 

You will need administration permissions to install and configure GLUE in your 
system. In Windows Vista and Windows 7, be sure to start your command console 
in administration mode (right click, then 'Execute as administrator').

Note that the GLUE binary distribution contains serveral components developed 
as JSE6 programs. In this document, the term GLUE_HOME will be used to name 
the base directory where all the JSE6 GLUE components are supposed to be 
located. Despite this, there are no real dependencies between the different 
components at the file system level. Feel free to move things to other 
locations if you need it, and check the runnable scripts 
in GLUE_HOME/bin, GLUE_HOME/manager/bin and GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/bin 
directories to find out how start every component.

The current VLE adapters included in the GLUE_HOME/vle_adapters/ directory 
are not standalone applications. They work as plugins in their respective VLEs.
The scripts referred in the INSTALLATION section of this document work only 
with the JSE6 components in GLUE_HOME/manager and GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters. 
See the INSTALL.txt file in each GLUE_HOME/vle_adapter/[component] directory
to manually install each plugin in its correspondent VLE.

# DEPENDENCIES #
################

GLUEletManager and the GSIC tool adapters are Java Standard Edition 6 (JSE6) 
program. You will need a JSE6 runtime platform installed in your system.

GLUEletManager needs a SQL database system to keep information about the tools 
to integrate, and to provide persistence for the created instances. Any common 
database system with a JDBC driver available should be suitable. You will need
to obtain the JDBC driver from your database system provider to grant 
GLUEletManager access to its databases.

MoodleAdapter is developed as a module for Moodle, so a running Moodle platform
is required. Supported versions of Moodle are those in the 1.9.x branch. 
Recommended versions are between 1.9.8 and 1.9.12, inclusive. Note that 
MoodleAdapter currently does not work with none of the Moodle 2.x.y versions.

MediaWikiVLEAdapter is developed as an extension for MediaWiki, so a running 
MediaWiki platform is required. Supported versions of MediaWiki are those 
from the 1.16 version. 

Additionally, GLUEletManager and the GSIC tool adapters have the following 
dependencies. All of them are included in the GLUE binary distribution as 
jar files in different subdirectories. Check the README.txt file for more 
information about each library and their original providers.

  - GLUECommon 0.9.2: library with common elements for GLUE Java components. 
  This library is located at GLUE_HOME/lib and is needed by all the 
  GLUEletManager and GSIC tool adapters.
	
  - RESTlet 2.0.11 for Java Standard Edition (only org.restlet.jar,
  org.restlet.ext.atom.jar and org.restlet.ext.xml.jar files). By now, we 
  discourage the use of any different RESTlet version with GLUEletManager.
  This library is located at GLUE_HOME/lib/dep/restlet-jse-2.0.11 and is 
  needed by all the GLUEletManager and GSIC tool adapters.

  - API and implementation of Java Persistence API 2 (JPA2). We provide 
  EclipseLink 2.0.0, but you could use any other JPA2 implementation instead. 
  This library is located at GLUE_HOME/lib/dep/eclipselink and is 
  only needed by GLUEletManager. It's placed in GLUE_HOME/lib because in 
  future updates of GLUE it will be needed by the GSIC tool adapters.
  
  - Google Data Client Library for Java 1.41.1. Provided to get access to 
  Google Docs. This library is located at 
  GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/gdata/lib/dep/gdata-1.41.1.and is only needed by 
  the Google Docs (GData) tool adapter.

  - Java Mail API 1.4.3. Provided as a dependency of Google Data Client 
  Library. This library is located at 
  GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/gdata/lib/dep/javamail-1.4.3 and is only needed 
  by the Google Docs (GData) tool adapter.
  
  - Wookie Connector Framework. Provided to get access to Apache Wookie 
  servers. This library is located at 
  GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/lib/dep/wookie-connector-framework 
  and is only needed by the Apache Wookie tool adapter.
  
  - Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J). Provided to get access to Wookie 
  Widgets as a dependency of Wookie Connector Framework. This library is 
  located at GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/lib/dep/slf4j and is only 
  needed by the Apache Wookie tool adapter.
  
Besides, the GSIC tool adapters provide access to external tools that have 
their own access rules and requirements. Check the INSTALL.txt file in each
GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/[adapter] for more detail.

Additionally, MediaWikiVLEAdapter has the following dependence included
in the MediaWikiVLEAdapter distribution. Check the README.txt file for its
copyright and license notice:

  - Protoype Window: JavaScript library to render a window over a HTML page.
    This library is located at MediaWikiVLEGlueExtension/javascript/windows
	(funcions) and MediaWikiVLEGlueExtension/themes (visual styles).


################
# INSTALLATION #
################

The next steps describe the installation of GLUEletManager and the GSIC tool
adapters in Linux and Windows systems. The VLE adapters included in the 
distribution must be separately installed in their correspondet VLE platforms.
Se their INSTALL.txt files at GLUE_HOME/vle_adapters/[adapter] for more 
details.

1) Choose and create your GLUE_HOME directory.

  ** Linux: directories /opt/glue, /usr/local/share/glue or /usr/share/glue 
     could be suitable paths for GLUE_HOME.

2) Define the system variable GLUE_HOME containing the full path to the chosen
GLUE_HOME directory:
	
  ** Windows: Start button > Control Pannel > System and Maintenance > 
	System > Advanced system settings > Advanced tab > Environment Variables 
	button. 

  ** Linux: Add 'export GLUE_HOME=/usr/share/glue' in /etc/bash.bashrc or 
  /etc/profile.
	
3) Extract the files from the binary package at GLUE_HOME. The following

4) ** Linux : grant execution permissions to the *.sh files in GLUE_HOME/bin, 
GLUE_HOME/manager/bin and GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/[adapter]/bin

    cd $GLUE_HOME
    chmod +x ./bin/*.sh ./manager/bin/*.sh ./tool_adapters/*/bin/*.sh
	
5) Place a copy of your JDBC driver in GLUE_HOME/lib/dep/jdbc-connector/ (as 
one or multiple jar files).

6) ** Linux: run GLUE_HOME/bin/install-glue.sh in order to:

    - create empty log files at /var/log/glue, and symbolic links pointing 
	to them at GLUE_HOME/manager/log and GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters[adapter]/log
	  
    - create symbolic links at /usr/bin pointing to the start and stop shell
	scripts in GLUE_HOME/manager/bin and GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/[adapter]/bin
	
    - create instances.txt files in /srv/glue/tool_adapters/[adapter] to
	  provide persistence to the objects created with every GSIC tool adapter,
	  and symbolic links pointing to them in 
	  GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/[tool_adpater]/data.
	
   ** Windows: run GLUE_HOME/bin/install-glue.bat to 
   
    - register GLUEletManager and the GSIC tool adapters as Windows services;
	
	- define the names of the log files to be created in GLUE_HOME\manager\log
	and GLUE_HOME\tool_adapters\[adapter]\log (they will be created with the 
	first start of GLUE)
	
    - create the file instances.txt in GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/[adapter]/data/
	to provide persistence to the objects created with the GSIC tool adapters.
	
	By default, GLUEletManager and the GSIC tool adapters will be registered 
	to be started at system boot time. Pass the parameter 'manual' to 
	install-glue.bat in order to avoid it and force the manual start of 
	the services.


###################################################
# CREATION, CONFIGURATION AND ACCESS TO DATABASES #
###################################################
	
GLUEletManager requires the existence of two separate databases. The directory 
GLUE_HOME/manager/conf/db contains create_GLUE_databases.sql, a SQL script file
defining the structure of both.

The first database, the Internal Registry, will keep the information needed 
to use every tool available to integrate in the GLUEletManager clients. Proper 
values for each tool must be inserted in the Internal Registry by the 
system administrator, according to the instructions provided by each tool 
adapter.

The second database is the GLUElets Repository. GLUEletManager saves in it the 
data about the objects created by its clients with the registered tools.

In order to create both databases execute the contents of 
GLUE_HOME/manager/conf/db/create_GLUE_databases.sql in the management console 
of your database system. The file 
GLUE_HOME/manager/conf/db/drop_GLUE_databases.sql executes the opposite 
operations to erase both databases. BE CAREFUL: this will make unaccesible the
objects previously created through GLUEletManager.

Don't forget to insert proper values in the Internal Registry after its 
creation. Check the INTERNAL REGISTRY section below for details about the 
tool adapters in this distribution, or ask for the details to your tool adapter 
provider if you want to add externally hosted adapters.

Finally, you must edit the file GLUE_HOME/manager/conf/META-INF/persistence.xml
to provide the details of the JDBC connection with your database system. You 
must edit the 'value' attribute of the following properties as your system 
requires (note that all of them appear TWICE in the persistence.xml file):
	
  <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.url" 
            value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/InternalRegistry"/> 
      URL to access each database; note that it includes the name of the 
	  databasex at the end (InternalRegistry and GLUEletsRepository).
		
  <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.user" value="glue"/>
      An authorized database user.
	  
  <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.password" value="glue"/>
      The password of the authorized database user. 
	  
  <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.driver" 
            value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>
	  Name of your JDBC driver class. Check your driver documentation.
	  
Note that the password is saved in text format. We strongly reccomend you to 
create and authorize a specific user for the sole purpose of GLUEletManager 
operation. This user will need, at least, read permissions over all the 
Internal Registry tables, and read and insertion permissions over the GLUElets 
Repository.


#####################
# INTERNAL REGISTRY #
#####################

Every tool adapter to be accessed with GLUEletManager must be registered in 
the Internal Registry. This distribution includes the file 
GLUE_HOME/manager/conf/db/fill_Internal_Registry.sql to make easier the 
registration process. 

Please, note that this file is a TEMPLATE: several variables marked with 
square brackets must be replaced with suitable values according to your 
particular environment. When the replacements are completed, the file may be 
run in your SQL compliant database management console to register all the 
tool adapters at once.

There are three tables where you must introduce your own values:

 * InternalRegistry.ToolServices: Apache Wookie and MediaWiki are not 
 centralized systems, but freely distributable software packages that let you
 create customized servers. So, a URL for a Apache Wookie server and a URL 
 for a MediaWiki server must be provided in the rows 6 and 7. 
 
 * InternalRegistry.ImplementationAdapters: the URLs where the tool adapters 
 will be listening for requests must be completed for all of them. BE CAREFUL:
 the suffix '/ToolAdapter/[ToolName]' can't be changed. If you install the 
 GSIC's Tool Adapters and GLUEletManager in the same host and don't change 
 the default ports, these could be suitable values for the full URLs:
    - 'http://localhost:8186/ToolAdapter/GData'
    - 'http://localhost:8187/ToolAdapter/WebContent'
    - 'http://localhost:8188/ToolAdapter/Dabbleboard'
    - 'http://localhost:8189/ToolAdapter/WookieWidgets'
    - 'http://localhost:8190/ToolAdapter/MediaWiki'
	- 'http://localhost:8192/ToolAdapter/Doodle'
	- 'http://localhost:8193/ToolAdapter/BasicLTI'
	- 'http://localhost:8195/ToolAdapter/facebookLiveStream'

 * InternalRegistry.ToolImplementations: each tool requires its very own 
 parameters to be inserted in the final column of this table as a string 
 containing a list of parameters according to the URL encoding format.
 Note that some adapters provide several tools. A different row for each tool
 must be present in this table. You will probably want to use the same values
 in all the tools accessed for each adapter, but this is not mandatory.
 
    - Google Docs adapter: A Gmail account will be needed for the creation of
	documents in Google Docs. Username and password for that account must be 
	inserted as values for the 'user' and 'pass' parameters. (Please, note 
	this is a provisional solution to be replaced in a near future).
	
    - Dabbleboard adapter: A Dabbleboard developer account will be needed 
	for the Dabbleboard adapter gets access to the Dabbleboard API. Please, 
	check http://www.dabbleboard.com/developer to obtain your developer 
	account and insert your username and developer key as values for the 
	'user' and 'pass' parameters. BE CAREFUL. The value need for the 'pass'
	parameter is your Dabbleboard developer key, not your Dabbleboard 
	password. Check the 'Account' section while logged-in at 
	http://www.dabbleboard.com to find your current developer key or generate
	a new one.
	
	- Apache Wookie adapter: A Wookie developer key will be needed to access
	your Apache Wookie server. Please, follow the link 'Request and API key 
	for your application' in your Apache Wookie server home page to obtain 
	your key. IMPORTANT: if your key contains any slash character (/), repeat 
	the process to get a different key. Then insert your developer key as the 
	value assigned to the 'devKey' parameter, changing spaces and any other 
	punctuation characters as the rules for URL encoding require.
	
	The URL to your Apache Wookie server must be inserted too, as the value 
	assigned to the 'feedURL' parameter. Remember to apply the URL encoding
	rules to the FULL URL, including the reserved characters. For example: 
	http://host.com:8888/wookie becomes http%3A%2F%2Fhost.com%3A8888%2Fwookie
	
	- MediaWiki adapter: A MediaWiki account in your MediaWiki server is needed
	to create new pages. Insert the credentials as values for the 'user' and 
	'pass' parameters.
	
	The URL to your MediaWiki server must be inserted too, as the value 
	assigned to the 'feedURL' parameter. Once again, remember to apply the URL
	encoding rules to the FULL URL, including the reserved characters.
	For example: http://host.com/mywiki becomes 
	http%3A%2F%2Fhost.com%2F/mywiki

For more details about the tools provided by each tool adapter, check the 
INSTALL.txt file in GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/[adapter].


#############
# OPERATION #
#############
	
Before starting GLUEletManager and the GSIC tool adapters you can edit the 
app.properties files placed in GLUE_HOME/manager/conf and 
GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/[adapter]/conf to change some runtime properties:

  - port     Number of the HTTP port where the component listens for requests.
  - logging  Keep to 'On' to save information in the log file about every 
             request processed by the component.

To manually start and stop GLUEletManager and the GSIC tool adapters all at 
once
  ** Linux: use the commands start-glue and stop-glue (links to start-glue.sh
  and stop-glue.sh in GLUE_HOME/bin).
  
  GLUEletManager and each GSIC tool adapter can be separately started or 
  stopped with their respective start and stop shell script files in 
  GLUE_HOME/manager/bin and GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/[tool_adapter]/bin. 
  Symbolyc links to them are created too in /user/bin. Check the INSTALL.txt
  of every component to see their names.
  
  ** Windows: run the batch files start-glue.bat and stop-glue.bat in 
  GLUE_HOME/bin.
  
  GLUEletManager and each GSIC tool adapter can be separately started or 
  stopped from the Windows service management panel:
    1) access to the service management panel: Start button > Control Pannel 
       > System and Maintenance > Administration Tools > Services;
    2) search and select the service with name 'GLUEletManager' in the services
       list;
    3) click the 'Init' or 'Stop' link at the top left corner of the list.

You can see the content of the log files at GLUE_HOME/manager/log and
GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/[adapter]/log to check if every component started 
without problems. You should see a couple of messages like these in 
manager.log:

  24-oct-2011 10:16:09 org.restlet.engine.http.connector.HttpClientHelper start
  INFO: Starting the default HTTP client
  
  24-oct-2011 10:16:14 org.restlet.engine.http.connector.HttpServerHelper start
  INFO: Starting the default [HTTP/1.1] server on port 8185
  
The GSIC tool adapters' log files will show just a message like the second one.


###############
# FINAL NOTES #
###############

1) If you need to restrict the access to GLUEletManager or any GSIC tool 
   adapter to a limited set of system users for its start/stop, keep in 
   mind that authorized users need:
     - execution permission on the scripts at GLUE_HOME/bin, 
	 GLUE_HOME/manager/bin and GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/[adatper]/bin/
	 - read permission on 
	    * all the app.properties files
		* GLUE_HOME/manager/conf/META-INF/persistence.xml
		* all the jar files
	 - write permission on /var/log/glue/*.log

2) The GLUEletManager databases may be located at a different host than 
   GLUEletManager, but they must be both in the same database management 
   system.

3) BE CAREFUL: In Windows systems, every time GLUEletManager or any GSIC tool
   adapter is started, the previous log file is erased.
