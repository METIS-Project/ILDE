# PRELIMINARY NOTES #
#####################

The binary distribution of WookieWidgetsAdapter has been packaged and tested 
for its use in GNU/Linux or Windows (XP, Vista or 7) systems. However, as a 
Java Standard Edition 6 (JSE6) program, it will probably run in other 
operating systems where a JSE6 runtime platform is available. Even so, this 
document will describe the installation and configuration process just for 
Linux and Windows systems, highlighting their differences when needed. 

You will need administration permissions to install and configure 
WookieWidgetsAdapter in your system. In Windows Vista and Windows 7, be sure 
to start your command console in administration mode (right click, then 
'Execute as administrator').

Note that the contents of the WookieWidgetsAdapter binary distribution are
designed to coexist with other GLUE components developed as JSE6 programs.
In this document, the term GLUE_HOME will be used to name the base directory
where all the JSE6 GLUE components are supposed to be located. Despite this,
there are no real dependencies between the different components at the file
system level. Feel free to move things to other locations if you need it, 
and check the runnable scripts in GLUE_HOME/bin and GLUE_HOME/[component]/bin 
directories to find out how start every component.

# TOOLS ADAPTED #
#################

GSIC's Apache Wookie Adapter is a tool adapter for GLUE that provides access 
to Apache Wookie, a solution for adding W3C Widgets to web applications as 
embedded objects.

Each accesible widget in a Wookie server will be handled by Apache Wookie 
Adapter as a separate tool. Currently, these widgets are supported:

  * Chat Widget
  * SharedDraw Widget
  * Sudoku Widget
  * Forum Widget
  * Natter Chat Widget
  * Bubble Game Widget
  * Butterfly Paint Widget
  * You Decide Widget


################
# DEPENDENCIES #
################

WookieWidgetsAdapter is a Java Standard Edition 6 (JSE6) program. You will need
a JSE6 runtime platform installed in your system.

Apache Wookie is a freely distributable software package for the creation of 
servers that provide and handle W3C Widgets. You will need an account in a 
Wookie server to use WookieWidgetsAdapter.

Additionally, WookieWidgetsAdapter has the following dependencies. All of them
are included in the WookieWidgetsAdapter binary distribution as jar files in 
different subdirectories. Check the README.txt file for more information 
about each library and their original providers.

  - GLUECommon 0.9.2: library with common elements for GLUE Java components. 
    This library is located at GLUE_HOME/lib
	
  - RESTlet 2.0.11 for Java Standard Edition (only org.restlet.jar,
    org.restlet.ext.atom.jar and org.restlet.ext.xml.jar files). By now, we 
    discourage the use of any different RESTlet version with 
	WookieWidgetsAdapter. This library is located at 
	GLUE_HOME/lib/dep/restlet-jse-2.0.11
	
  - Wookie Connector Framework. Provided to get access to Apache Wookie 
  servers. This library is located at 
  GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/lib/dep/wookie-connector-framework.
  
  - Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J). Provided to get access to Wookie 
  Widgets as a dependency of Wookie Connector Framework. This library is 
  located at GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/lib/dep/slf4j.

# INSTALLATION #
################

1) Choose and create your GLUE_HOME directory.

  ** Linux: directories /opt/glue, /usr/local/share/glue or /usr/share/glue 
     could be suitable paths for GLUE_HOME.

2) Define the system variable GLUE_HOME containing the full path to the chosen
GLUE_HOME directory:
	
  ** Windows: Start button > Control Pannel > System and Maintenance > 
	System > Advanced system settings > Advanced tab > Environment Variables 
	button. 

  ** Linux: Add 'export GLUE_HOME=/usr/share/glue' in /etc/bash.bashrc or 
  /etc/profile.
	
3) Extract the files from the binary package at GLUE_HOME. The following
contents will be added.

4) ** Linux : grant execution permissions to the *.sh files in 
GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/bin:

    chmod +x $GLUE_HOME/manager/bin/*.sh
	
5) ** Linux: run 
   GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/bin/install-wookiewidgets.sh in 
   order to:
   
    - create the file /srv/glue/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/instances.txt to 
	  provide persistence to the objects created with the WookieWidgets tool
      through WookieWidgetsAdapter, and a symbolic link in 
	  GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/data pointing to it;
	  
    - create the empty log file /var/log/glue/wookiewidgets_adapter.log, and a 
	  symbolic link pointing it at GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/log;
	  
    - create symbolic links start-wookie and stop-wookie at /usr/bin pointing 
	  to GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/bin/start-wookiewidgets.sh 
	  and GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/bin/stop-wookiewidgets.sh
	
   ** Windows: run 
   GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/bin/install-wookiewidgets.bat to:
   
    - create the file GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/data/instances.txt 
	  to provide persistence to the objects created with the WookieWidgets 
	  tool through WookieWidgetsAdapter;
	  
    - register WookieWidgetsAdapter as a Windows service;
	
	- define 
	  GLUE_HOME\tools_adapter\wookiewidgets\log\wookiewidgets_adapter.log as 
	  the log file (it will be created with the first start of 
	  WookieWidgetsAdapter).
	
	By default, WookieWidgetsAdapter will be registered to be started at system
	boot time. Pass the parameter 'manual' to install-wookiewidgets.bat in 
	order to avoid it and force the manual start of WookieWidgetsAdapter.

	
#####################
# INTERNAL REGISTRY #
#####################

Every tool adapter to be accessed with GLUEletManager must be registered in 
the Internal Registry. This distribution includes the file 
GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/conf/db/fill_Internal_Registry.sql to 
make easier the registration process.

Please, note that this file is a TEMPLATE: several variables marked with
square brackets must be replaced with suitable values according to your 
particular environment. When the replacements are completed, the file may be
run in your SQL compliant database management console to register the
Google Docs adapter.

IMPORTANT: if you got GSIC's Apache Wookie adapter as part of the full GLUE 
distribution package, you will prefer to use the 
GLUE_HOME/manager/conf/db/fill_Internal_Registry.sql file to register all 
the tool adapters at once. See the INSTALL.txt file at GLUE_HOME.

The first column in all the tables modified by fill_Internal_Registry.sql is 
an integer identifier that works as a primary key for the row added. You must 
select a non used value in the rows previously existent in your Internal 
Registry.

BE CAREFUL: all the identifiers but [TOOL_IMP_ID] appear repeated in 
fill_Internal_Registry.sql as references in tables different to those where 
they are primary keys. Keep the value of each identifier consistent all over
the file.

Besides the identifiers, there are three tables where you must introduce your 
own values:

 * InternalRegistry.ToolServices: Apache Wookie is not a centralized system, 
 but a freely distributable software package that lets you create customized 
 servers. So, a URL for a Apache Wookie server must be provided.
 
 * InternalRegistry.ImplementationAdapters: the URLs where the tool adapters 
 will be listening for requests must be completed. BE CAREFUL: the suffix 
 '/ToolAdapter/WookieWidgets' can't be changed. If you install the 
 GSIC's Apache Wookie adapter and GLUEletManager in the same host and 
 don't change the default port, a suitable value for the full URL could be
 'http://localhost:8189/ToolAdapter/WookieWidgets'.

 * InternalRegistry.ToolImplementations:  some values must be inserted in 
 the final column of this table as a string containing a list of parameters 
 according to the URL encoding format. Note that eight tools are supported,
 and a different row for each tool must be inserted. You will probably want 
 to use the same values for all the tools, but this is not mandatory.
 
	- Apache Wookie adapter: A Wookie developer key will be needed to access
	your Apache Wookie server. Please, follow the link 'Request and API key 
	for your application' in your Apache Wookie server home page to obtain 
	your key. IMPORTANT: if your key contains any slash character (/), repeat 
	the process to get a different key. Then insert your developer key as the 
	value assigned to the 'devKey' parameter, changing spaces and any other 
	punctuation characters as the rules for URL encoding require.
	
	The URL to your Apache Wookie server must be inserted too, as the value 
	assigned to the 'feedURL' parameter. Remember to apply the URL encoding
	rules to the FULL URL, including the reserved characters. For example: 
	http://host.com:8888/wookie becomes http%3A%2F%2Fhost.com%3A8888%2Fwookie
	

#############
# OPERATION #
#############
	
Before starting WookieWidgetsAdapter you can edit the file 
GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/conf/app.properties to change some 
runtime properties:

  - port     Number of the HTTP port where WookieWidgetsAdapter listens for 
             requests.
  - logging  Keep to 'On' to save information in the log file about every 
             request processed by WookieWidgetsAdapter.

To manually start and stop WookieWidgetsAdapter:

  ** Linux: use the commands start-wookie and stop-wookie.
  
  ** Windows: 
    1) access to the service management panel: Start button > Control Pannel 
       > System and Maintenance > Administration Tools > Services;
    2) search and select the service with name 'WookieWidgetsAdapter' in the 
	   services list;
    3) click the 'Init' or 'Stop' link at the top left corner of the list.

You can see the content of 
GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/log/wookiewidgets_adapter.log to check if 
WookieWidgetsAdapter started without problems. You should see a message like 
this:

  24-oct-2011 10:16:09 org.restlet.engine.http.connector.HttpServerHelper start
  INFO: Starting the default [HTTP/1.1] server on port 8187  


###############
# FINAL NOTES #
###############

1) If you need to restrict the access to the WookieWidgetsAdapter to a limited
   set of system users for its start/stop, keep in mind that authorized users
   need:
     - execution permission on GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/bin/*.sh
	 - read permission on 
	    * GLUE_HOME/tool_adapters/wookiewidgets/conf/app.properties
		* all the jar files
	 - write permission on /var/log/glue/tool_adapters_wookiewidgets.log

2) BE CAREFUL: In Windows systems, every time WookieWidgetsAdapter is started, 
   the previous log file is erased.
