Google data API - README for source package
Mar 21, 2007

Overview
========
The Google data APIs ("GData" for short) provide a simple standard protocol for
reading and writing data on the web. GData combines common XML-based
syndication formats (Atom and RSS) with a feed-publishing system based on the
Atom publishing protocol, plus some extensions for handling queries.

Google also provides a set of client libraries for interacting with
GData-enabled services, in a variety of programming languages. Using these
libraries, you can construct GData requests, send them to a service, and
receive responses.

Several services currently support the GData API. A complete up-to-date list
along with respective documentation can be found on the GData site:
http://code.google.com/apis/gdata
