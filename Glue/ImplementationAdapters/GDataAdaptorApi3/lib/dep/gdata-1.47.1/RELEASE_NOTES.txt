Notes for v1.24.0
-----------------
Oct 20, 2008
o  Added support for version 2 of Google Data API.  API versioning is
   rolled-out in phases and currently limited documentation about API
   versioning is available at
   http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol.html#API_Versioning.
   As of this release only YouTube Data API supports version 2.
   Version 2 provides significant feature enhancements including:
   1. Added Support for caching through http ETag headers.  The implementation is
      compatible with specification in RFC 2616 with support for If-Match,
      If-None-Match, If-Modified-Since headers.  Other conditional headers are
      not supported.
   2. Updated OpenSearch namespace from http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearchrss/1.0/
      to http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/.
   3. Introduced "GData-Version" header to indicate requested protocol
      version.  The GData-Version header value is of format
      "<major_version>.<minor_version>".  Possible values as of this release
      are "1.0" and "2.0".  The version information can also be specified
      using "v=2.0" query parameter.
   All version 2 enabled Google Data API Services will continue to support
   version 1 of the protocol.  If both "GData-Version" header and "v" query
   parameter are not specified in the request, the server defaults to
   version 1.0.
o  Updated com.google.gdata.client.youtube.YouTubeService class to use
   version 2 of the YouTube Data API as default version. Refer to YouTube API
   developer guide at
   http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol.html for
   details on version 2 API.  Refer to YouTube Data API Migration Guide at
   http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/migration.html for details on
   breaking changes from version 1 to version 2, and details on how to migrate
   your code to work with version 2 of the YouTube Data API.
   NOTE: There are breaking API changes between version 1 and version 2.
   Though it is not required to upgrade to version 2.0 immediately, it is
   highly recommended to upgrade version 2.0.  Older versions of YouTube Data
   API libraries will continue to work until version 1.0 is deprecated.
